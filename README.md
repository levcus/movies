Movie Trailer Website Version 1.0 11/09/2015

This project creates a responsive website using the movie's info available. The 
project contains three modules (media.py, entertaiment.py and fresh_tomatoes.py
). The required movie's info is title, stotyline, actors, release date, poster 
image and Youtube trailer and is stored in the entertaiment.py module. In order
to create the website the entertaiment.py module has to be run. This creates an 
HTML file named fresh_tomatoes.html
